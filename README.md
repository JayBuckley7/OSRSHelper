# OSRSHelper

---I fixed the highscore widget for myself because I use it a lot but didnt bother fixing CML the actual HS page, it no longer shows virtual levels, the old version is down because the owners website buying-gf.com is down, if he brings it back up no code changes are needed on the app so I probably won't commit this to his ---

Do you sometimes feel the urgent need to look up your total level or your daily gainz on Old School Runescape, but cannot because you're away from the computer? How many times have you missed that golden opportunity to show that girl at the bar that you have over 1k total levels, and that you once gained 1.4m cooking experience in a single day? 

We solved that problem for you. You can now consult your tracker experience and your hiscores from this new app, and it's super fast.
